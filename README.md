# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN and OpenCV

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from webcam input in real-time.

## Features

- Trains on the MNIST dataset
- Real-time digit prediction using OpenCV
- Live bounding box for ROI (Region of Interest)

## Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
